## Game Title
Arson's Stand

## Narative

Arson is just a simple guy with a simple life, all he knows is the fire he was born from, his home. Tucked in by the fire and ready for bed, he began drifting off. Suddenly, he heard a raindrop, and then another. He picked up his fire gun, ready to defend the hearth at all costs.

## Controls
